## Notes
I may have overcomplicated some parts and made suboptimal choices due to my limited experience with PixiJS. I also think that if there is a big project it's better to use FSD arcgitecture, the approach I implemented works with small projects only. Overall, the task was very interesting and fun, and I truly enjoyed working on it! :)

# Softgames Test Assignment

## Games

- **Ace of Shadows** — A card stacking animation that continuously moves cards from one stack to another with smooth transitions.
- **Magic Words** — An interactive word-matching puzzle game with scrolling and dynamic dialogue display.
